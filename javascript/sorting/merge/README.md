# Merge

The merge sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that sorts an array by dividing the array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two halves together. For example the array [8,4,23,42,16,15]. The array is divided into [8,4,23] and [42,16,15]. The first half is divided into [8,4] and [23]. The first half is divided into [8] and [4]. The first half is merged into [4,8]. The second half is merged into [23]. The first half is merged into [4,8,23]. The second half is divided into [42] and [16,15]. The first half is merged into [42]. The second half is divided into [16] and [15]. The first half is merged into [16]. The second half is merged into [15]. The second half is merged into [15,16]. The second half is merged into [15,16,42]. The first half is merged into [4,8,23]. The array is now sorted.
